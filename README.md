# auto-resume
Code for automating my resume.

This code is written in Google Apps Script in the Google API environment.

It is written to augment a Google Sheet version of my resume. The Google Sheet portion has checkboxes to select categories of experience, education, skills, and attributes that best fit the qualifications outlined in a job listing. The scripts in this repository are attached to buttons in the Google Sheet to allow the user (me) to automatically format, resize, and print the resume to PDF.
